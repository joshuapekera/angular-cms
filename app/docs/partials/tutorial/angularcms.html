<p>Follow these steps when adding features to this project.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Textual scenario</strong> - Each story will have a textual scenario that describes what should occur.</li>
<li><strong>GUI mock-up</strong> - Visual mock-ups of the story will show how the UI should look. </li>
<li><strong>Storyboard</strong> - Along with the mock-ups, steps in the process will make up a storyboard. </li>
<li><strong>Class diagram</strong> - Diagrams of how modules should be constructed.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithm design</strong> - Textual algorithm design will explain how the implementation should work.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong> - The actual development of the code will take place.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Unit and e2e testing will then verify the implementation of the story. </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

<h2 id="importantnotes">Important notes</h3>

<p>Please don't edit files in the <code>dist</code> subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the <code>src</code> subdirectory!</p>

<h3 id="codestyle">Code style</h4>

<p>Regarding code style like indentation and whitespace, <strong>follow the conventions you see used in the source already.</strong></p>

<h3 id="phantomjs">PhantomJS</h4>

<p>While Grunt can run the included unit tests via <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the <code>test/*.html</code> unit test file(s) in <em>actual</em> browsers.</p>

<h2 id="modifyingthecode">Modifying the code</h3>

<p>First, ensure that you have the latest <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a> installed.</p>

<p>Test that Grunt's CLI and Bower are installed by running <code>grunt --version</code> and <code>bower --version</code>.  If the commands aren't found, run <code>npm install -g grunt-cli bower</code>.  For more information about installing the tools, see the <a href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started">getting started with Grunt guide</a> or <a href="http://bower.io/">bower.io</a> respectively.</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork and clone the repo.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm install</code> to install all build dependencies (including Grunt).</li>
<li>Run <code>bower install</code> to install the front-end dependencies.</li>
<li>Run <code>grunt</code> to grunt this project.</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming that you don't see any red, you're ready to go. Just be sure to run <code>grunt</code> after making any changes, to ensure that nothing is broken.</p>

<h2 id="submittingpullrequests">Submitting pull requests</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a new branch, please don't work in your <code>master</code> branch directly.</li>
<li>Add failing tests for the change you want to make. Run <code>grunt</code> to see the tests fail.</li>
<li>Fix stuff.</li>
<li>Run <code>grunt</code> to see if the tests pass. Repeat steps 2-4 until done.</li>
<li>Open <code>test/*.html</code> unit test file(s) in actual browser to ensure tests pass everywhere.</li>
<li>Update the documentation to reflect any changes.</li>
<li>Push to your fork and submit a pull request.</li>
